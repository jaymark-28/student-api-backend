Attendance Management Portal
A web portal for lab attendance. A teacher can add students with the dates they attended, see them in a list, fix a misspelled name or a wrong date, and delete wrong or duplicate records.

Page: public/index.html (plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no build step)
API: api/index.js, a Vercel serverless function at /api
Database: MongoDB Atlas, database LabAttendanceDB_Bisquera, collection daily_attendance (the name is set in db.js, so it does not depend on what the connection string contains)
Live site: https://bisquera-api-backend.vercel.app/

CRUD
In the page	API call
Create	Add student form: student name, section, subject and date	POST /api
Read	Student list for the chosen class day, with search and section and subject filters	GET /api
Update	Edit on a student: fix a misspelled name, section or subject, and change, add or remove dates. The check button marks a student present for the day.	PUT /api?id=… and PATCH /api?id=…
Delete	Delete on a student, after a confirmation box	DELETE /api?id=…
The page shows a message after every add, save and delete, and asks before it deletes anything.

API
All routes are at /api. Records look like this:

{ "_id": "…", "studentName": "Juan Dela Cruz", "section": "BSIT-3A", "subjectName": "Database 2",
  "attendanceDates": ["2026-10-08T00:00:00.000Z"] }
Method	What it does	Body	Success
GET	All records	none	200 and a list
POST	Add a student	{ studentName, section, subjectName, attendanceDates? }	201 and the new record
PUT ?id=<_id>	Fix name, section or subject. If attendanceDates is sent it replaces the old list.	same as POST	200 and the record
PATCH ?id=<_id>	Mark present on one day	{ "date": "YYYY-MM-DD" }	200 and the record
DELETE ?id=<_id>	Delete the student and their dates	none	200 and { "deleted": true }
attendanceDates is a list of days like ["2026-10-08", "2026-10-15"]. Errors: 400 bad input, 401 wrong or missing key, 404 no such record, 409 the same student is already listed for that section and subject, 503 the server has no WRITE_KEY.

Security
The MongoDB connection string exists only as the Vercel environment variable MONGODB_URI. It is never in the page or in this repo (.env files are git-ignored).
Anyone can read. Writes (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) need the header x-api-key to match the WRITE_KEY environment variable. The teacher types the key once into the page (Teacher key), and it stays in that browser only.
The server checks every input: required fields, maximum lengths, real calendar dates and valid ids. The page writes names with textContent, so a name can never inject HTML.
Deploy on Vercel
Push this repo to GitHub.
In Vercel choose Add New, Project and import the repo. No build command is needed.
Under Settings, Environment Variables add MONGODB_URI (the Atlas connection string mongodb+srv://… for a database user that can read and write LabAttendanceDB_Bisquera) and WRITE_KEY (a password of your choice). Redeploy afterwards.
In Atlas, Network Access must allow Vercel. Its addresses change, so a class project usually allows 0.0.0.0/0.
Every push to main deploys to production again.
Tests
npm test runs the API tests with the database stubbed out, so no connection string is needed.
